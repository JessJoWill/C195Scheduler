•Customer Scheduling Interface

• This program collects, displays and manipulates information about your customers and their appointments. It allows you to add/modify/delete customers, add/modify/delete appointments, view reports on several aspects of your data, including appointment schedules. It restricts appointments outside the business hours of 8:00AM and 10:00PM EST, and prevents overlapping appointments for your customers.

• Run the program with IntelliJ IDEA, with JavaFX and MySQL Connector drivers (specified below) loaded. Log in with the credentials test/test or admin/admin and either choose to view reports, add a customer, or select a customer from the table to begin managing appointments.

• The third report I created lists each first level division and country in the database, and shows the customer count for each one, showing zero when no customers are present.
